# Iris Classification Models
This project uses the Iris dataset to train three different classification models: KNN, Random Forest Classifier, SVM Classifier, and Logistic Regression Classifier. It also includes a FastAPI implementation that exposes endpoints to execute each of the trained models.

 ### Objective 
 The objective of this project is to develop a classification model that can accurately predict the type of iris flower based on the given attributes, such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The purpose of this project is to showcase how to train different classification models on a small dataset and deploy them using FastAPI.

### Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 instances of iris flowers, with 50 instances for each of the three different types of iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica). Each instance includes four attributes: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
